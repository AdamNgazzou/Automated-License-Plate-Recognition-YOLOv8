# License Plate Detector & Recognizer üöóüîç

A robust end-to-end pipeline for automatic vehicle and license plate detection, tracking, and recognition in videos. Built with YOLOv8, custom-trained models, SORT tracking, and OCR, this project enables accurate extraction and export of license plate data from traffic footage.

## Features

- **Vehicle Detection:** Uses YOLOv8 COCO model for robust vehicle localization.
- **License Plate Detection:** Employs a custom YOLOv8 model for precise license plate detection.
- **Vehicle Tracking:** Integrates [SORT](https://github.com/abewley/sort) for multi-object tracking across frames.
- **OCR Recognition:** Utilizes EasyOCR for reading license plate text from detected plates.
- **CSV Export:** Outputs bounding boxes, recognized text, and scores to CSV for further analysis.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone github.com/AdamNgazzou/Automated-License-Plate-Recognition-YOLOv8
   cd licence_plate_detection
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Clone the SORT tracking module:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abewley/sort.git
   ```

---

## Usage

Run inference on the sample video:

```sh
python main.py
```

- **Output CSV:** Results are saved in `outputs/main.csv`
- **Output Video:** Visualization saved as `out.mp4`

You can adjust input/output paths in `main.py` and `visualise.py` as needed.

---

## Results

- **CSV Output:**  
  All detected vehicles, license plates, bounding boxes, and recognized text are exported to `outputs/main.csv`.

- **Visualization:**  
  Annotated video with bounding boxes and recognized plates is saved as `out.mp4`.

- **Sample Output:**

## Future Improvements

- Support for multi-language license plates
- Real-time inference and streaming support
